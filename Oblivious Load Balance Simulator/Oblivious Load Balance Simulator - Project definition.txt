Project parameters:
===================

1. load:
	a. The length of jobs - exponential with an average of 1. (Normalized according to the number of servers)
	b. Rate of jobs - translated to (0,1) scale, so 0 means no jobs, 1 means a new job arrival at every time unit. 
2. Number of servers.
3. Queues:
	a. Every server has X slots available (Aggregated on both queues).
	b. A distribution parameter (d in [0,1]) so that d*X slots in HQ and (1-d)*X slots in LQ.
	c. Should also support infinite queues.
	d. When buffers are full jobs are discarded. 
	
Stats
=====

1. Average time of job in system (discarded jobs don't count)
2. Number of discarded jobs: 
	a. percentage out of total
	b. distribution according to HQ/LQ
3. Should support numbers of Â±:
	a. 20 servers.
	b. 10,000 jobs each.
	c. 10% of initial and final jobs statistics should be discarded.
